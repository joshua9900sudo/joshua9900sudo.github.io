# Converse, Inverse, and Contrapositive of a Statement

In logic, the **converse, inverse, and contrapositive** of a statement are different ways of rearranging a conditional (if-then) statement. Let’s break them down with an example.

---

## 1. Original Statement (Conditional Statement)
A conditional statement is usually in the form:
**"If P, then Q"** (symbolically: \( P \rightarrow Q \)).

🔹 **Example:**
*"If it rains, then the ground will be wet."*
( \( P \) = "It rains", \( Q \) = "The ground is wet" )

---

## 2. Converse (역, 逆)
The **converse** of a statement is formed by swapping \( P \) and \( Q \):
**"If Q, then P"** ( \( Q \rightarrow P \) ).

🔹 **Example:**
*"If the ground is wet, then it rained."*
🚨 This is **not always true**, as the ground could be wet for other reasons (e.g., someone watered the plants).

---

## 3. Inverse (이, 否定)
The **inverse** of a statement negates both \( P \) and \( Q \):
**"If not P, then not Q"** ( \( \neg P \rightarrow \neg Q \) ).

🔹 **Example:**
*"If it does not rain, then the ground will not be wet."*
🚨 This is also **not always true**, because the ground can be wet due to other factors.

---

## 4. Contrapositive (대우, 對偶)
The **contrapositive** negates and swaps \( P \) and \( Q \):
**"If not Q, then not P"** ( \( \neg Q \rightarrow \neg P \) ).

🔹 **Example:**
*"If the ground is not wet, then it did not rain."*
✅ This is **always logically equivalent** to the original statement.

---

## Summary Table

| Statement Type | Logical Form | Example |
|--------------|--------------|---------|
| **Original** | \( P \rightarrow Q \) | "If it rains, then the ground is wet." |
| **Converse (역)** | \( Q \rightarrow P \) | "If the ground is wet, then it rained." (❌ Not always true) |
| **Inverse (이)** | \( \neg P \rightarrow \neg Q \) | "If it does not rain, then the ground is not wet." (❌ Not always true) |
| **Contrapositive (대우)** | \( \neg Q \rightarrow \neg P \) | "If the ground is not wet, then it did not rain." (✅ Always true) |

---

## **Key Point**
- The **contrapositive** is always **logically equivalent** to the original statement.
- The **converse** and **inverse** are not necessarily true unless the original statement is a **biconditional** (i.e., "if and only if").
